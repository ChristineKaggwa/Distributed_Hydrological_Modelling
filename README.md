# Distributed Hydrological Modelling And River Network Analysis


 ![Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dba3cf98-c5ff-4b23-a85b-8081716b4d69)

## 1. Distributed hydrological modelling 

Data inputs: Gridded Climate Data
- Precipitation
- Temperature
- Evapotranspiration

Vertical routine: HBV routine 
Lateral routine: 
- River routing
- Reservoir and Lake routing




## 2. Reservoir routing
- Based on mass balance
- Functions include regression
- Piecewise linear regression
## 3. Kinematic river routing


# River Network Analysis of Regulation Effects
- Dymanic degree of regulation
- Dynamic degree of flow lateratio
